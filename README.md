Tiny Ruby App That Allows Browser Based Video Chatting


installation
------------

I suggest getting a recent Ruby version with [RBENV](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](http://rvm.io/), install [Bunlder](http://bundler.io/) and then run:

`bundle install`

usage
-----

start with: `ruby vidup.rb`

use with Chrome/Chromium

**warning:**
------------

Sometimes it works really great, sometimes it does not. Pull requests welcome!
