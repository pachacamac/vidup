vidup
=====

Tiny Ruby App That Allows Browser Based Video Chatting

start with: ruby vidup.rb

EDIT: Since Google decided to not allow WebRTC over non-https sites in Chrome anymore, I updated and created a new version: vidup_ssl.rb. Also see nginx-server.conf.example. For free ssl certs check out letsencrypt.


**warning:** Sometimes it works really great, sometimes it does not. Pull requests welcome!

EDIT: The new https version (vidup_ssl.rb) seems to be a bit more stable
